## Pneumonia Detection From Chest Radiograph (CXR) 

### Problem Statement :

Pnumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both of the lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus(purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficult breathig. It can be found in kids, alults and seniors. In many cases it may cause a death. As a data scientist my job is to build a model that can detect Pneumonia at early state so it can treated propely.

### Approach

Approach I took on this project is building a Deep Learning Model which train on Pneumonia data that was provided by Kaggle competition. Link : <https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data> 

The dataset is 3.7 GB in size with over 30k CXR Images of patients. Images are labeled with 3 different classes: Normal, Lung opacity, No lung opacit/not normal. The goal is first identify correctly identify which the images that Pneumina.
